# Sports Activity Logger

This is a cool Java program I made to keep track of sports stuff! You can:
- Add sports you did
- See everything you logged
- Check how many hours you spent on sports in the last week

It’s all text-based, so you just type stuff in and it tells you what’s up.

## How to Use It

### Getting Started
1. Make sure you have Java installed on your computer. (I used Java 17, but it should work with most versions.)
2. Save the `LogSportActivities.java` file somewhere.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and go to where the file is.
4. Compile it by typing: `javac LogSportActivities.java`
5. Run it with: `java LogSportActivities`

### Using the Program
When you start it, you’ll see a menu like this:

- **1 - Add activity**: Type the sport name (like "Running") and how many hours you did it (like "1.5" for 1 hour 30 minutes). It’ll save it with the current time.
- **2 - See all activities**: Shows everything you’ve added so far with dates and times.
- **3 - Get weekly total**: Adds up all the hours from the last 7 days and tells you the total.
- **4 - Quit**: Stops the program. Bye-bye!

If you type something wrong (like letters when it wants numbers), it’ll just say “Oops” or something and let you try again.
